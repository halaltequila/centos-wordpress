Adapting from Ubuntu to CentOS for a Wordpress Installation

NOTES: 
*** the 'apt' package will be replaced with 'yum' :)
*** apache2 will be replaced with httpd except when using commands, i.e: apachectl configtest
*** Initially, PHP will be installed with an older version, it has to be updated repeatedly in order for PHP to be updated
Download Wordpress Zip
1. download wget: sudo yum install wget
2. download tar: sudo yum install tar 
3. proceed to download wordpress. sudo wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
4. then, extract the file using tar: sudo tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
5. Now that I had the file downloaded, I used the LAMP method (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP) in order to properly make my wordpress functional.
INSTALL HTTPD
6. Update your systems using sudo yum apt update, sudo yum -y upgrade
7. Install httpd (apache2) sudo yum install httpd
8. Once httpd has been installed, use sudo systemctl start httpd and sudo systemctl enable httpd
9. Use sudo systemctl status httpd to confirm that apache2 is running.
10. Now we will create our default web page. Use cd /var/www/html/ 
11. Use sudo nano index.html to write HTML, ctrl^c and ctrl^x out.
INSTALL PHP 
12. Install these PHP packages for wordpress to be functional with httpd and CentOS. Use sudo yum install to install 
php
php-cli
php-mysql
php-gd
php-xml

Also install 

mysql
mysql-server

INSTALL MARIADB

I installed MariaDB with sudo yum install mariadb-server mariadb-client and checked the status. After installation, I set up the wordpress db and created the user and credentials. 

At this point, having credentials means that you can go to /var/www/html/wordpress and sudo cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php and fill out the credential details. I also created login.php and distros.php and completed the variables with the database credentials for the wordpress database.

After double checking the credentials and ensuring all services are running, I put in ;IP ADDRESS;/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php to complete the wordpress installation through the browser. I did experience an issue where my firewall was not allowing http access, so be sure to enable HTTP traffic before anything else. 

These were the steps I took to install wordpress on CentOS!
